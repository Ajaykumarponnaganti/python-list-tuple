# Case Study: Employee Attendance Management System

## Objective

Build a simple Employee Attendance System using lists and tuples in Python.

## Problem Statement

A company wants to track employee attendance using Python. The system should:

- Store employee records (ID, Name, Department).
- Mark attendance (Present/Absent) for each employee.
- Allow searching for attendance records by employee ID.
- Display a summary of attendance.

**Employee Details Tuple**

```python
(employee_id, employee_name, department)
```

**Attenance Records**

This will be a list of tuples.
```python
[(employee_id, date, status), ...]
```
